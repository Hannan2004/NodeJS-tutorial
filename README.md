# Backend MERN Training by Codecell VESIT

Welcome to the Backend MERN Training repository! This repository is part of the backend training sessions held by **Codecell VESIT**, the tinkers of the Computer Department.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains code snippets and projects covered over three days of intensive training. Below is the structure of the repository and what you will find in each folder:

### Day 1: Basic Node.js Code Snippets
The `day1` folder contains basic Node.js code snippets. These examples lay the foundation for understanding Node.js, including:
- Basic server setup
- Handling HTTP requests and responses
- Working with modules

### Day 2: Express Code Snippets
The `day2` folder dives deeper into Express.js and covers more advanced topics such as:
